Generate doxygen using `doxygen ./Doxyfile` the target
directory is `doc/html`. Browse to `doc/html/index.html`.

##### DEPLOYMENT ROADMAP

```
ðŸ›‘ Operating a Construct server which is open to public user registration is unsafe. Local users may
be able to exceed resource limitations and deny service to other users.
```

- [x] **Personal**: Dozens of users. Few default restrictions; higher log output.
- [ ] **Company**: Hundreds of users. Moderate default restrictions.
- [ ] **Public**: Thousands of users. Untrusting configuration defaults.

> Due to the breadth of the Matrix client/server protocol we can only endorse
production use of Construct gradually while local user restrictions are
developed. This notice applies to locally registered users connecting with
clients, it does not apply to federation.
